## Overview and Description:
    A Full-Stack Chrome Extension application designed for Spokeo to assist its clients query their reserve lookup search engine. It combines Google Chrome Extension's API, Spokeo's customer search engine and a custom web scraper that uses Puppeteer to analyze static or dynamic web content to find applicable phone numbers and emails to search. The frontend was built with React. Unfortunately, permision was not granted by client to share propietary source code.
    
## Features and Usage:

    This application is client-specific and was created for Spokeo to publish on Google Chrome pending completion. 

    The extension performs a scrape of any dynamic or static web page and creates custom links of any available phone or email in the front end. 

    The extension uses local storage to save results of each web page for the client's convenience. It also alerts the client via extension badge to show the client how many results exist per page.

    Currently usage for this extension is client-specific, where Client will maintain and further develop. Also, READ ## Licensing below.

## Application Requirements:

    Third Party APIs:

        [Chrome Extension API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index) created by Google to provides extensions with many special-purpose APIs, like messaging and setting icons.

        [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) created and designed by Google, Material Design is a design language that combines the classic principles of successful design along with innovation and technology.
    
    Primary Node Packages: 

        [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

        [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
